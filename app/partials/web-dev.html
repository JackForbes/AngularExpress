  <h4>Web Development</h4>

    <p>Although I was only introduced to serious programming in University, I have fallen in love with software engineering and web development. I may have, at times, preferred to do Math homework over English homework, but I have never truly enjoyed homework until my GENE 121 (programming) class during my first year at University. Creating something out of nothing electronically is somehow much more gratifying than physical construction, even more than Lego! The assignments were thrilling, like building a game or solving a puzzle by creating the necessary formulas or algorithms. Not to mention it was rewarding to discover that the solutions came to me relatively easily.</p>

    <p>For my third co-op term I decided to try something different from what I had previously been doing, and worked in project manDuring the 2012 winter school term, a classmate and I conceptualized a music recommendation system that we later called “NextBestSong”. Together, with a USC student and a former Microsoft employee, the four of us worked to develop the product and website. My classsmate and I were one of only 15 groups accepted into the Enterprise Co-op program at the University of Waterloo for our first work term. We were also the youngest students to be awarded this honor. My role in the company has been creating the user interface, all functionality, and connecting the interface to our database. Over the course of the summer, I learned a great deal of programming and learned many new languages. We are still at work to release the Beta for NextBest Song.com.agement at BC Hydro in Vancouver and Langley, BC. Jumping into the world of project management taught me a lot in a short amount of time, from dealing with the politics of managements, to tight deadlines. Having experience in both software development and project management has given me a valuable outlook on running a functional and cohesive technology company.</p>

    <p>For my second Co-op term I was fortunate enough to work in Silicon Valley for Gumstix Inc as a Growth Hacker. Words truly cannot describe how enjoyable those four months in California were. They say that no matter how nice a place is to live, people will get used to it. Well four months must be the perfect amount of time to live somewhere because I loved every minute of it, from the weather, to the weekend adventures, to the work itself! The most rewarding part was probably just the fact that I actually enjoyed the work I was doing and looked forward to coming to work each day. It gave me great confidence in my career choice, as my idea of becoming a web developer/software engineer was solidified. Not to mention diving into the technology capitol of the world is a huge learning experience!</p>

    <p>My latest project involved creating a music matrix with two other friends, while in Vancouver. This grid of squares involves using a Web Audio API to play tones with different frequencies, depending on which square the user clicks on. I saw this same idea done using Flash and thought it would be fun to try with HTML5! Here it is: http://innovativedesign.github.io/</p>

    <p>Another project that I made for my Database Structures class, involves playing with the NHL Statistics from last year’s playoffs. It uses PHP to query a MySql database with the 2012-2013 NHL players and teams. Feel free to insert, modify, or delete players to see how they compare to the rest. Check it out!</p>
